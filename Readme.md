Animating Gradients Project:

This personal project was an exercise to play around with animating gradients.  I found out how to animate a change in the gradient's array of colors, and how to animate a change in the locations property of the gradient.  Both of these examples used a repeating NSTimer to kick off each animation cycle.

Lastly, I was able to connect the animation of the gradient to a change in tilt of the phone using the accelerometer.  In this example, the location of the gradients animates relative to the tilt, tracking both left and right directions, of the phone.
